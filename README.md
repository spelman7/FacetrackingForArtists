#### Learning Objectives

Using a computer to track somebody's face is inherently kind of technical. So we're going to look at faces from a technical perspective. That involves two different pieces - how we (humans) perceive faces, and how computers perceive them.

But, since this is actually an art workshop, we're going to try to connect those technical bits back to some artistic ideas. So in between all the technical stuff, we'll look at some awesome projects & pieces which play with faces in interesting ways.

Then we'll also be playing with some of the technology ourselves :)
